		<h1>Explore Perfume</h1>
		<h3>For anyone who loves perfume or wants to know more about the world of aroma and the sense of smell, this is a true "encyclopaedia" of information:  an eye-opening – maybe nostril-opening? – section which answers all your questions:  about shopping for perfume, wearing it, about ingredients and the whole process of perfume-making – and much, much more, including the fascinating history of the scented world… Want to read about the creators, or ‘noses’?  Read about the world’s leading perfume houses, and their creations…?  Know which books on the subject can deepen your appreciation even further?  It’s all here.</h3>
